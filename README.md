# Implemented Architecture Patterns

## Clean Architecture

```text
API
Application
Domain
Infrastructure
```

Responsibilities are clearly separated to improve maintainability, testability, and scalability.

---

## CQRS

Command Query Responsibility Segregation implemented using MediatR.

### Commands

```text
CreateProductoCommand
CreateCompraCommand
CreateVentaCommand
RegistrarEntradaCommand
RegistrarSalidaCommand
```

### Queries

```text
GetProductosQuery
GetInventarioQuery
GetStockQuery
```

---

## Event-Driven Architecture

Services communicate asynchronously through RabbitMQ events.

Examples:

```text
compra.registrada
venta.registrada
```

---

## Outbox Pattern

Guarantees reliable event publication.

Events are first persisted in the database and later published asynchronously by a dedicated background worker.

Benefits:

* No event loss
* Better resilience
* Eventual consistency
* Reliable integration

---

## Inbox Pattern

Provides idempotent event processing.

Each processed event is stored and validated before execution to avoid duplicate processing.

Benefits:

* Safe retries
* Duplicate message protection
* Reliable consumer behavior

---

## Distributed Trace Propagation

Trace identifiers are propagated between microservices and integration events.

Benefits:

* End-to-end request tracing
* Easier troubleshooting
* Improved observability

---
